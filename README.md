# Obstacle-Detection-and-Distance-Prediction-System-
This project focuses on detecting obstacles and predicting their relative distance categories Too Close, Close, or Far using only RGB images or videos.
It is primarily designed for applications in small robots and drones to enhance environment awareness and navigation safety.

The system integrates object detection with depth-based distance classification, providing a simple yet effective perception module for obstacle analysis.
